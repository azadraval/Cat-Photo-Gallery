# Photo Gallery Project

This is my photo gallery project, created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. I built a responsive image gallery that showcases cat photos using CSS Flexbox.

## Project Overview

The Photo Gallery project helped me learn how to create a responsive layout using CSS Flexbox. The gallery displays a collection of cat images that automatically adjust based on the screen size, demonstrating the power of flexible layouts.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:
- Implementing CSS Flexbox for layout design
- Creating responsive designs that work on different screen sizes
- Managing image display properties
- Handling multiple elements in a container
- Using proper semantic HTML
- Adding media queries for responsive adjustments
- Styling headers and content sections
- Optimizing image presentation

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Flexbox)

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The HTML structure with the gallery container and images
- `styles.css` - The CSS styling that implements Flexbox and responsive features

## Design Elements

The gallery features:
- A clean, responsive layout
- Evenly spaced image tiles
- Images that resize fluidly with the browser window
- A simple header with consistent styling
- Rounded corners on images for visual appeal
- Flexible wrapping of images based on available space

This project was especially valuable for teaching me how Flexbox can simplify complex layouts that would be difficult to achieve with traditional CSS positioning methods.
